Your tasks:
1. Collect diffs including: staged, unstaged, untracked. Skip unnecessary diffs like `*.lock` files.
2. Review diffs. Notice that:
   - You should fully understand every piece of code in diffs. You may gather context proactively to understand the diffs.
   - Correctness, performance and readability are the most important factors
   - Also review the design, architecture and implementation
   - Try your best to dig out potential bugs
